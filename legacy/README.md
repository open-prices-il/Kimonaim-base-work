This project will allow you to download any prices file from the largest Israeli grocery retailers. 
The data is based on the files these companies are legally required to publish, but which is erased every day. 
Links to all these files can be found here: https://www.gov.il/he/departments/legalInfo/cpfta_prices_regulations

the "downloader" scripts bring you the original files from the sites.
the "unzipper" script turns zipped files into xml files.
the xml2DB file uploads the xml files into a database.
